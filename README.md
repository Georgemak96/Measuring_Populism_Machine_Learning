# Measuring Populism with Supervised Machine Learning
R code implementing ML models and figures of the paper "Measuring Populism in a Comparative Perspective using the Comparative Manifesto Project Coding Categories". The paper introduces a Gradient Boosting Machine model to predict populism on a continuous dimension. Then uses the model's predictions to derive a populism score. The full paper is available above ('Final_Paper.pdf')
